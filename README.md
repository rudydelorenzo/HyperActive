# Welcome to HyperActive
Utility for synchronized control of Blackmagic's HyperDeck line. It will allow you to connect to many HyperDeck devices over the network, and can control all of them simultaneously.

We make use of the BMD Hyperdeck API (telnet) to communicate.

The application already has a login system implemented as a foundation for advanced analytics in the future.

## Technologies
* Java
* JavaFX
* Telnet
* Asynchronous UI
* IoT
* Authentication & Hashing

## TODO:
* Save replay `x` seconds prior by hitting `x` on NumPad.
* Add ability to remove HyperDeck.
* Allow speed changes via scroll wheel.
